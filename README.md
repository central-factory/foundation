# The Central Factory Foundation

## Manifesto

### Power for the people. 

We truly believe in the Open Source as a way to give more freedom and power to the people. For that reason, we will keep the core of our software open.

### Integrity as a sign of identity

We won't sell your data ever, and you will always have the chance to keep your data locally so you don't depend on anyone.

### Community-driven development

We'll offer the tools so anyone can develop new ways to contribute to the system.

### Eco-friendly

We will try to offer the most ecological solution based on the technologies available as long as they don't conflict with the other points
